# Site Creation Tool

##Framework

Dynamic front-end site prototype following the principles of [Atomic Design][http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/]. Product starts out-of-the-box as a clickable prototype of a typical higher education website. 

'''

##TODO:

- Remove client-specific logos/text
- Change color scheme to grayscale
- Add additional components to examples pages (dropdown, matrix, module, table, colorbox, event, news, factoid, profile, subsection, spotlight)
- Style sitemap page
- Clean complex functions (subnav, main nav, promo)
- Figure out a way to not need numbering on directories for ordering purposes within subnav/main nav

'''

##Specifics:
- Functions are called within each index. Each function builds upon a string representing a specific region within the specified layout. 
- Main navigation is built from the numbered folders on the root. (skips 0 examples folder)
- Dynamic navigation (main/mini/subnav) skips all "dot" directories.
- .sitemap directory creates a full nested sitemap.

###/settings.php
- Generic pages start with the settings.php file on the root. This file gives info on the base paths needed to access needed files.

###/globals.php
- Functions used globally that don't impact content (like components do)
