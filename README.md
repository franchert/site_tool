# Site Creation Tool

##Framework

Dynamic front-end site prototype following the principles of [Atomic Design][http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/]. Product starts out-of-the-box as a clickable prototype of a blank higher education website. 

Each index file pulls in a specified 'layout' file, which represents the front-end code. The layout file then pulls in the header and footer. The header pulls in stylesheets and script files.

It also pulls in a 'director' file, which represents the dynamic and back-end components. The director file pulls in components functions, which are organized into groups within the components directory. It also pulls in global functions (which are functions that don't directly impact content but used many places), as well as a variables file, which calculates dynamic per-page variables such as path, page titles, section and mini-site information.

##TODO:

- Add additional components to examples pages (colorbox, profile, subsection, spotlight)
- Explain process and how to get started using the tool.
- Figure out a way to not need numbering on directories for ordering purposes within subnav/main nav
- Print Stylesheets

---

##Specifics:
- Functions are called within each index. Each function builds upon a string representing a specific region within the specified layout. 
- Main navigation is built from the numbered directories on the root. (skips directories beginning with a . or a 0)
- Dynamic navigation (main/mini/subnav) skips all "dot" directories.
- .sitemap directory creates a full nested sitemap.

###/settings.php
- Generic pages start with the settings.php file on the root. This file gives info on the base paths needed to access needed files.

###/globals.php
- Functions used globally that don't impact content (like components do)
